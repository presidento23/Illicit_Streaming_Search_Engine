# Illicit_Streaming_Search_Engine

Prompts user for input for the title and type of media they would like to find. And when applicable the number of seaons the user expects.

This is my first project and I'm so happy that I was able to finish.

If you would like to add websites to the searchable list simply create  locators for the website. Add a page for the landing page and 
post search screen.
Then you can just copy the functions I have listed for the other pages. You will need to modifiy them slightly in order to make sure 
they function properly

If you would like to remove a website from the list then simply remove it's position from the variable list_of_sites in SearchFeatureForBootlegSites
and as well delete the functions from the search_for_movie/tv in SearchFeatureForBootleg.

The Search is particularly slow due to websites having lots of ads. I would suggest adding ad block or something of that nature.

IMPORTANT.
DO NOT SHORTEN THE IMPLICILITY WAIT TIME FOR DRIVER. THE WEBSITES WILL NOT LOAD AND AFTer ENOUGH TIMES, WILL LEAD YOUR IP TO BE BANNED
FROM THAT WEBSITE!
